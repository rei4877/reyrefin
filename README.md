# Hi! 👀

I'm Rey Refin! 👋

I'm a digital artist dealing in multiple disciplines 💻

I mainly focus on UI/UX and graphic design, character illustrations and music compositions! 👨‍🎨

I also do a bit of HTML/CSS, although still in training! 🌐

My GitHub is just for me to post some small scripts and codes I've done in my free time, out of either boredom or annoyance.

You can reach and find my works here:
- Email: rey.refin <at> gmail.com
- Bandcamp: https://reyrefin.bandcamp.com/ (for acoustic music) or https://mykono5.bandcamp.com/ (for electronic music)
- No place to post my illustrations yet, unfortunately!
